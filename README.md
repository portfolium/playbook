# Portfolium Development Playbook

These guidelines form the foundation for building high quality, scalable applications as efficiently as possible. In a rapidly evolving ecosystem of tools and frameworks, our approach combines widely accepted principles and practices with battle-tested libraries and active community support.

This is intended to be a living document that grows and evolves over time. Everyone is encouraged to share their thoughts and contribute to produce the best possible resource.

## Contributing to Projects

Developers are encouraged to reference this guide when contributing to all Portfolium projects. These rules are intended to make our project histories easier to read and our code review workflow more efficient. Eventually, we'll be able to automatically generate meaningful release notes with each deployment.
