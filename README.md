These guidelines form the foundation for building high quality, scalable applications as efficiently as possible. In a rapidly evolving ecosystem of tools and frameworks, our approach combines widely accepted principles and practices with battle-tested libraries and active community support.

This is intended to be a living document that grows and evolves over time. Everyone is encouraged to share their thoughts and contribute to produce the best possible resource.

## The Frontend Playbook

### [Frameworks & Libraries](https://github.com/portfolium/playbook/blob/master/docs/frontend/frameworks-libraries.md)

A list of the frameworks and libraries we've chosen to use to build our frontend web applications.

### [Coding Style](https://github.com/portfolium/playbook/blob/master/docs/frontend/coding-style.md)

To ensure all developers are speaking the same language, we have adopted guidelines for coding style in Javascript, HTML, and Sass. We are currently working to automate the enforcement of these guidelines, but developers must be proactive for the time being.

### [Project Structure & Organization](https://github.com/portfolium/playbook/blob/master/docs/frontend/project-structure-organization.md)

Projects should be structured using [LIFT](https://angular.io/styleguide#!#04-01) to encourage modularity and allow developers to find code easily. Scripts, templates and stylesheets are grouped together as components, forming the building blocks of a component-based architecture.
