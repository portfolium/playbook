## Coding Style

### Javascript

Airbnb has done an excellent job compiling a practical style guideline for modern javascript. We've forked the project so we can modify it slightly to suit our needs (4 spaces ftw). Whenever an argument over style arises, consult the guide first. We've also configured [eslint](http://eslint.org/) to [enforce the style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/linters/.eslintrc). Many of the rules are currently overwritten in the web project, but will be re-enabled as we correct all the affected files.

### Angular

We loosely follow John Papa's AngularJS style guide. We've deviated in a few areas so we can't attempt to follow it 100%. We've also incorporated some of the principles of the Angular (version 2+) style guide in an attempt at easing the migration process in the future.

Todd Motto has created a great resource that's been kept up-to-date with best practices for Angular 1.6 with one-way data flow, components, etc. We've pieced together our Angular style from these two sources, so there is no definitive style guide resource at this time.

### Templating

We don't yet have a formalized guideline to follow for HTML templates, other than the HTML5 spec. More to come.
